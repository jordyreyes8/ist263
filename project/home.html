                    Basketball is one of the most fast-paced sports and this comes with its consequences. Basketball players 
                    are constantly working out every part of their body while enduring physical contact. This can cause a lot of 
                    wear and tear on the athletes’ bodies, and it is important that they take the right precautions to assure 
                    they are in good condition.
