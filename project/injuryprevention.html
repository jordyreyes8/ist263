                    Foot and ankle injuries are usually caused by lack of foot support. Basketball shoes were made for this 
                    exact reason. However, not all basketball shoes offer the same type of support. The best way to prevent 
                    foot and ankle injuries are by selecting high top basketball shoes with a lot of ankle support. There are 
                    many low top and mid top basketball shoes, but they may not offer sufficient ankle support. Another way 
                    to assure your ankles are protected is by taping up your ankles with athletic tape.

                <img src="IP3.jpg" alt="IP3">
                <p>The best way to prevent wrist and hand injuries is by being aware on the court. I’ve personally suffered 
                    from a wrist facture and I’m certain that if I was more aware of how I was landing I could’ve prevented the 
                    injury. It is important to be aware of other players on the court, the basketball, and how you land. If you 
                    fall while playing basketball it is crucial that you don’t land on your hands.

                <p>There isn’t much you can do for head and face injuries but simply being careful. You should always be 
                    aware of your surroundings and should never get too aggressive on the court. A lot of these injuries 
                    happen on accident, so it is crucial that you be as careful as possible.
