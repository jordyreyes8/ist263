            <p>Hi! I’m currently an information management & technology major with a dual concentration in data analytics and 
            Web Design & Management. I’m currently debating between a career in data science or software engineering. I’ve 
            received my <strong>first 2 college internships offers</strong> for data related roles which I am very excited about. I’ve interned before at <strong>Accenture</strong> back in high school. On my free time I enjoy playing basketball, 
            hanging out with friends, listening to music, and traveling. I hope to one day have a technology position in the Real estate industry and make a big impact on the latest technological innovations. I also want to dive into real estate investing at some point in my future, and eventually be at a position of power where I can help my family and friends.
            </p> 

            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        
            <p> was born and raised in the <strong>Bronx, NY</strong> and my parents arre both from the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>. I have 2 little sisters and one of them is only about to be 2 years old! I used to play basketball back in high school but unfortunately I broke my wrist in the middle of high school, causing me to be unable to play until I got to college. I still do keep up with my passion for basketball whenever I have free time. </p>
