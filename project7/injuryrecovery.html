                        The RICE treatment is a popular method of recovering from minor to moderate foot and ankle injuries. 
                        RICE stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. You should rest the injured foot/ankle, ice it, 
                        compress it with elastic bandages and elevate it on something like a pillow.

                        The RICE treatment is also a good treatment for hip and thigh injuries. A crucial part about recovering from
                        these injuries is resting for enough time. It can take up to 6 weeks or more to heal from a hip strain and a 
                        thigh strain can take 10 days to 3 weeks to fully heal.

                        To recover from minor to moderate knee injuries it is important that you take a break from physical 
                        activity and rest your knee as much as possible. You should also apply ice packs frequently to reduce pain 
                        and swelling and follow the RICE treatment.
