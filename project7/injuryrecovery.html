                    The RICE treatment is a popular method of recovering from minor to moderate foot and ankle injuries. 
                    RICE stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. You should rest the injured foot/ankle, ice it, 
                    compress it with elastic bandages and elevate it on something like a pillow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The RICE treatment is also a good treatment for hip and thigh injuries. A crucial part about recovering from
                    these injuries is resting for enough time. It can take up to 6 weeks or more to heal from a hip strain and a 
                    thigh strain can take 10 days to 3 weeks to fully heal.

                <P>
                    To recover from minor to moderate knee injuries it is important that you take a break from physical 
                    activity and rest your knee as much as possible. You should also apply ice packs frequently to reduce pain 
                    and swelling and follow the RICE treatment. 
                </P>

                <h2>Wrist and Hand Injury Recovery</h2>
                <p>
                    To recover from wrist and hand injuries you should refrain from physical activity and use the RICE 
                    treatment for at least a week. For more serious injuries a doctor may recommend you put your hand in a 
                    cast for a few weeks to a few months. 
                </p>

                <h2>Head and Face Injury Recovery</h2>
                
                <p>
                    If you suffered from a head injury you should immediately take some time out to relax and recover. If the 
                    injury is more serious you should visit a doctor immediately. Sometimes a head injury can take a few days 
                    or weeks to heal, but in more serious cases you may need a doctorâ€™s diagnoses and treatment.
